# Avalonia Binding Samples

This repo has a few samples of doing view binding in Avalonia. 

* The AvaloniaSampleBinding project shows you how to push and pop views in your project.
* The AvaloniaTabBinding project shows you how to bind different tabs to different view models in your project.

Neither of these projects use any part of `ReactiveUI` for ease of understanding and similarity to WPF.
